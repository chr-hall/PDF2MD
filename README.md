# PDF2MD

pdf2md is a Node.js package for converting PDF documents to Markdown.

This program adds a GUI to pdf2md and lets users select individual files to convert. Normally pdf2md only supports batch converting the entire contents of a selected folder, which isnâ€™t always ideal. Written in Java.
